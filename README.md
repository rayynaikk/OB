plan your own approach for developing aspiring/potential leaders within the organization.

The complication in this situation is to create certain environment that can always guarantees a continuous growth and build an adaptive and politically savvy leaders, who possess a broad understanding of the organization's operations, culture, and challenges.
The question is how to resonate leadership development efforts based on the needs of the company with the goal of the potential leaders.

The best solution is the rotational programs.
We can design certain programs involving a series of rotations where participants spend a set period until the completion of certain projects, often ranging from a few months to a year, in various roles or locations, with the exposure to different functions, departments or geographic locations within.

The first recommendation is rotation within department, Which we can employ without a big budget, but just by planning or based on the participants interest in a specific career path.
Participant will gain diverse skill set. They will gain a lot of industry knowledge and they will be able to understand different business processes and interdepartmental communications easily.


Rotation within companies location, We have to plan a proper budget for this programe.
The participants won't think local, they will think Global as well.
they are working out of a specific city, state or a country, they they will always meet a new culture and traditions that will automatically teach them a lot of cultural awareness and the main thing for the participant would be a network expansion.
They will have a very clear idea about whom to contact when what certain type of issue arises during a project. They will get to be in touch of a lot of people, not just professionally, but in personal life as well. And it will directly affect their communication skills.


The third recommendation is the rotation within roles in.
In this program they the the main thing that the participants will develop is problem solving skills when they are working on almost similar roles 
This will directly make them independent for the future, whenever they are working, even if it's a group project or an independent project. So, uh, so this will give them a very wide range of skill sets and It is feasible for them to pass on the knowledge, even if even if they don't Reach the top of the hierarchy, they can be a good mentor to transfer the knowledge from thsse experiences.
